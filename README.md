# MAD_Project
This is our Mini Group Project in MAD Module.

Many people of our country are unable to go out to buy daily necessities due to covid-19 pandemic and this lockdown period. And in present, people are advised to stay at home by the government as well. So, people are afraid to go out. As a result, the number of customers visiting our company on an average day has decreased by about 50%. As a solution to this, we focused on creating an E-Commerce app for sells our products via online. Through this App, we look forward to serving all the people in Sri Lanka.
“Veterans” app allows customers to easily discover products what they are looking to buy. Through this app, the customer can order the required item with using cash and card. After completing the order will be delivered to customer doorstep through our delivery service. This application aims to provide relevant services even during the travel restrictions period. For these reasons, we hope that a growing number of consumers will gather around this application. In the future, we aim to further enhance this app with new features such as website and Delivery services tracking, and Payhere’s payment gateway integration. Adding products and services to the database of this application is done by the administrator through our admin portal website.

There are four main functionalities we identified in this system
•	Manage Customer Account and Wishlist
•	Manage Product and Cart
•	Manage Payment and Shipping
•	Manage Rate Product
